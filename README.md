# 👨‍🏫 React Progressive Learning

Welcome to **React Progressive Learning**, where I teach and build at the same time. This project is designed not just to show what I’m learning in React — but to help **you** learn right alongside me!

We'll explore the core building blocks of React including **components**, **state**, **props**, and wrap it all up with **modern deployment tools** like **Vite** and **GitHub Pages**.
